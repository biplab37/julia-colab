# Running Julia in Google Colab

## Steps
 1. Click the link to open the demo file in google colab [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/biplab37/julia-colab/Demo.ipynb)

 2. Run the first shell and wait till it completes running. It should not take more than a minute to run.
 3. Refresh the page and run the second shell ( `versioninfo()` ) to see the installation was successful. That's it you can use the notebook to run further commands in julia
 4. To get a new notebook make a copy of this notebook (`File > Make a Copy`) and repeat the steps 2-3 again.
